In other words, the reason you get up in the morning. An individual’s ikigai should be their calling, it should be something they are passionate about and good at. It should be something the world needs and if necessitated be able to provide financial rewards. The Japanese believe that everyone has their own Ikigai and finding it is an essential journey to bring satisfaction and meaning to life.</p>
